# This Chrome Extension project is part of my Javascipt self-learning.

## This project was built using simple HTML, CSS and mainly Javascript.

## I'm using Chrome Local Storage to store the saved data so the next time we come back the stored data is still there

## The manifest.json file contains configurations for deploying the project to Google Extension Page
