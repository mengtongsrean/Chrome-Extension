# This Chrome Extension project is part of my Javascipt self-learning. This project was built using simple HTML, CSS and mainly Javascript.

I'm using Chrome Local Storage to store the saved data so the next time we come back the stored data is still there

The manifest.json file contains configurations for deploying the project to Google Extension Page
